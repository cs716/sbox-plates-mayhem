Plates of Mayhem
A round-based survival game heavily based on Plates of Fate: Mayhem (Roblox - Created by DylanBuildar) / Plates of Fate: Remastered (Roblox - Created by Zephy and Supermushroom8).

The goal of Plates of Mayhem is to be the last player standing by surviving anything and everything the game (and other players) throws at you.

Current support events:

High gravity
Increases the gravity level

Low gravity
Decreases the gravity level

Explosive Barrel Rain
Explosive barrels rain from the heavens exploding on whatever (or whoever) they touch. This event lasts 30-seconds.

Glass Plates
Select plates turn into glass. Affected plates become translucent. You can still jump to/from the plate, but any impact harder than a player landing from a default jump height at default gravity will cause it to shatter immediately.

Poison Plates
Select plates turn poisonous. Any players who land on the plate will be infected. This currently does nothing.

Lava Spinner
A lava spinner will spawn on selected plates. This beam (adjusted to the scale of the plate) will spin constantly. Any players who come in contact with it will be damaged.

Landmines
A landmine will spawn on selected plates. This landmine is detonated by players getting too close or another object (or lava spinner) impacting it. They will also explode if damaged by another entity (including other landmine detonations).

Grow Event
Selected plates will grow by a random percentage

Shrink Event
Selected plates will shrink by a random percentage

Player Swap
Players will be randomly paired together and then their positions swapped at a random time between 5 and 25 seconds. The time is randomized to stop people from throwing themselves off of their plate during a swap for a cheap kill. You still can, but it's risky.

Plague
1-5 players will be infected with the plague. The plague gives you a green "sick" status indicator in the bottom right of your HUD. At random (between 5-30 seconds), you will sneeze infecting any nearby players and taking a small amount of damage. Any players nearby will also be given the plague.
